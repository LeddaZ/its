# its

Projects made during my full stack web developer course.

## What's in here

- `cs`: C# projects.
- `java`: Java projects; finished ones will be compiled automatically and can be downloaded as JARs from the [Releases](https://github.com/LeddaZ/its/releases) page.
- `node`: Node.js projects. They've been added here as submodules, so if you clone this repo make sure to use the `--recursive` option.
